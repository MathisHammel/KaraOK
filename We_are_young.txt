8.6
Give me a second I 
10.3
I need to get my story straight
12.5
My friend's are in the bathroom getting 
14.7
higher than the empire state
16.8
My lover she is waiting for me
18.8
just across the bar
20.4
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses
23.1
asking about
23.9
a scar, and
25.3
I know I gave it to you months a go
29.4
I know you're trying to forget
32.7
But between the drinks and subtle things
35.3
The holes in my apologies you know
38.1
I'm trying hard to take it back
40.8
So if by the time the bar closes
43.9
And you feel like falling down
46.6
I'll carry you home
49.7
Tonight
53.2
We are young
57.8
SO let's set the world on fire
61.8
We can burn brighter 
64.6
than the sun
