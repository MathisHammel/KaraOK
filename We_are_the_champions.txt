1.0
I've paid my dues
5.0
Time after time.
9.0
I've done my sentence
12.5
But committed no crime.
16.5
And bad mistakes
21.0
I've made a few.
25.0
I've had my share 
25.5
of sand kicked in my face
28.5
But I've come through.
35.0
We are the champions, my friends,
42.0
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
50.3
We are the champions.
58.0
No time for losers
61.0
'Cause we are the champions 
65.5
Of the world
77.5
I've taken my bows
81.0
And my curtain calls
85.5
You brought me fame and fortune 
87.0
and everything that goes with it
90.0
I thank you all
92.5
But it's been no bed of roses,
97.0
No pleasure cruise.
100.0
I consider it a challenge
101.5
before the whole human race
104.0
And I ain't gonna lose.
111.0
We are the champions, my friends,
118.5
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
126.5
We are the champions.
134.0
No time for losers
137.0
'Cause we are the champions
140.0
of the world.
144.0
We are the champions, my friends,
150.5
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end.
158.0
We are the champions.
165.5
No time for losers
169.5
'Cause we are the champions.
